#### Demo

This was a quick 60 minute SwiftUI challenge to recreate this component from another user's Figma mockup. It was pretty straightforward; there were no major roadblocks during development<br>

### Overall Design
<img src="Image/full.png" width="200"> <img src="Image/mini.png" width="200"><br>

The overall UI design is pretty clean and Apple-esque. I took the liberty to spruce up the AudioVisualizer component and make it green.<br>

> At some point I may revisit this project and make the card a bit more reusable. There isn't much code though so it may not be necessary.<br>

### Conclusion

This was a fun little SwiftUI exercise that takes less than an hour to implement. If you're feeling up to it then take on the challenge yourself!<br>
