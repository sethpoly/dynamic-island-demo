#### Demo

This was a quick 60 minute SwiftUI challenge to recreate this component from another user's Figma mockup. It was pretty straightforward; there were no major roadblocks during development<br>

### Overall Design
<img src="Image/full.png" width="200"> <img src="Image/mini.png" width="200"><br>

The overall UI design is pretty clean and Apple-esque. I took the liberty to spruce up
the AudioVisualizer component and make it green.<br>

*The slide-out menu is lacking details such as item names and quantity in cart, but those things are easy to add.*<br>

### Conclusion

This was a fun intermediate delve into iOS development using SwiftUI. Maybe I'll create a more detailed write-up in a tutorial style if I find the time.<br>
